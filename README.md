# Prisjakt deal scraper

I'm using puppeteer to scrape x pages of "Todays deals" and presenting them in JSON.

Not really sure what to do with this data, but I'm thinking scheduling it, saving in to a local database and just present the new deals since last time the script ran.

## Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/tonygustafsson/prisjakt-deals.git
cd prisjakt-deals
npm install
npm start
```

## Requirements

- NodeJS
- GIT
